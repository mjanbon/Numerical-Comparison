# Is Numerical Comparison Digital? #

This project will recreate the first experiment from Dehaene et al's 1990 paper 'Is Numerical Comparison Digital? Analogical and Symbolic effects in Two-Digit Number Comparison'. This experiment seeks to investigate whether number comparison is done holistically or digit by digit. It does so by examining the time it takes to determine whether a presented number is bigger or smaller than a reference number, in this case 55. The numbers 11-99 (excluding 55) are presented to the participant in such a way that:
1. The numbers from 41-69 are presented four times and the numbers from 11-40 and 70-99 are presented twice.
2. Two identical numbers are not presented twice in a row.
3. Three numbers bigger than 55 or three numbers smaller than 55 are not presented in a row.

The experiment hopes to show that there is a distance effect for both reaction time and error rate for these two-digit comparisons: reaction time for numbers further from 55 should be higher and the error rate for these numbers should also be lower.
