# Is Numerical Comparison Digital? #

This project will recreate several experiments from Dehaene et al's 1990 paper 'Is Numerical Comparison Digital? Analogical and Symbolic effects in Two-Digit Number Comparison'. These experiments investigate whether number comparison is done holistically or digit by digit. The data analyses from the original paper will also be recreated.
